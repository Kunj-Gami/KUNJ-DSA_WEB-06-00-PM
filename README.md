# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)


This repository is dedicated to the **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**. The course focuses on in-depth learning and application of **C++** for solving algorithmic problems and implementing various data structures.

## Objectives:
- Master the concepts of **Data Structures** such as Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, and Graphs.
- Understand and implement **Algorithms** including searching, sorting, and optimization techniques.
- Learn how to optimize solutions for time and space complexity.
- Solve real-world problems using **C++** and enhance problem-solving skills.

## Topics Covered:
- **Introduction to C++**: Syntax, data types, operators, and control structures.
- **Arrays & Strings**: Array manipulation, string operations, and pattern matching.
- **Linked Lists**: Singly, doubly linked lists, and their operations.
- **Stacks & Queues**: Implementation and use cases in solving algorithmic problems.
- **Trees**: Binary trees, binary search trees, and tree traversal techniques.
- **Graphs**: Representation of graphs, DFS, BFS, and shortest path algorithms.
- **Sorting & Searching Algorithms**: Bubble sort, merge sort, quicksort, binary search.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Solving optimization problems and handling overlapping subproblems.

## Tasks:
- **Implement basic data structures** in C++.
- **Solve algorithmic challenges** using the concepts learned.
- Work on assignments and projects that require optimization and analysis of time and space complexities.

## Submission Guidelines:
- Submit your solutions and assignments via **GitHub**.
- Include well-documented code with **comments** explaining the logic behind each function.
- Link your code to live execution or example inputs/outputs if possible.

## Learning Outcomes:
- Develop strong problem-solving skills.
- Gain proficiency in **C++** and its application in algorithmic problem-solving.
- Be able to analyze and optimize algorithms based on **time** and **space complexity**.
