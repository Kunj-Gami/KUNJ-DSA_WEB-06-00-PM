# Task: Understanding Pointers and Function Calls in C++

## Objective:
This task will help you understand the following concepts in C++:
- Pointers and dereferencing
- Array of Pointers
- Chain of Pointers (Linked List)
- Passing Arrays to Functions
- Call by Value vs Call by Reference
- Reference Variables

## Tasks:

1. **Pointers:**
   - Declare a pointer and point it to an integer variable.
   - Modify the value of the integer through the pointer and output the result.

2. **Array of Pointers:**
   - Create an integer array and an array of pointers pointing to each element.
   - Output the values of the array through the pointers.

3. **Chain of Pointers (Linked List):**
   - Create a simple linked list using dynamically allocated memory.
   - Display the linked list and free memory.

4. **Passing Arrays to Functions:**
   - Create functions to print and calculate the sum of an array using pointers.

5. **Call by Value vs Call by Reference:**
   - Implement functions that swap two values using Call by Value and Call by Reference.
   - Compare the results.

6. **Reference Variable:**
   - Create a reference variable for an integer and modify its value through the reference.

## Requirements:
- Implement all tasks in a single C++ file.
- Include comments to explain your code.
- Push your code to GitHub and provide a link to the live demo (using Vercel or Netlify).
- Submit a screenshot of the output showing correct functionality.

## Submission Details:
- **Deadline:** January 1st, 2025, before 5:59 PM.
- Submit the GitHub link and demo link if applicable.

## Evaluation Criteria:
- Correctness of logic and output.
- Proper use of pointers, arrays, and references.
- Clear explanations in comments.
- Code readability and structure.
